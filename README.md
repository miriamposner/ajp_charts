# ajp_charts
To gather this data, I obtained PDFs of every issue of *The American Journal of Psychiatry* from 1910 to 1960 and then used OpenCV to extract all of the images. I then hand-tagged the images according to the following categories:

*anatomical diagram
*apparatus
*brain section
*building
*chart
*hands
*histology
*historical
*history
*other
*other diagram
*patient
*patient-produced artifact
*physician
*specimen
*x-ray
*
